# SocialNetworkApp
A social network app, which allows users to register, to like each other, upload profile photos, etc. Also, it includes a private chat system and sections like About, Interests, Photos for each member. The application is made with ASP.NET Core Web API 3.0 in the backend, and Angular v.10 in the frontend. In development mode, I have used SQLite database, whereas in production mode, MySQL and/or SQL Server 

# Technologies Used
Backend - ASP.NET Core Web API 3.0

Frontend - Angular CLI 10.0

CSS Framework - ngx bootstrap, alertifyjs/alertify css 

# Development Server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Code scaffolding
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive | pipe | service | class | guard | interface | enum | module.

# Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.
